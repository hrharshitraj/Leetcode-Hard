/*
Hint-
(1/2)
Is dynamic programming suitable for this problem?
(2/2)
If we know the longest palindromic sub-sequence is x and the length of the string is n then, 
what is the answer to this problem? 
It is n - x as we need n - x insertions to make the remaining characters also palindrome.

    final int n = s.length();
    // dp[i][j] := LPS's length in s[i..j]
